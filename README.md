# Choosing a battery for projects

## Choosing batteries for electronic projects depends on many factors. Among these: the capacity, price, weight...etc. The table below shows the properties of the most common four batteries that are used in electrical and electronic projects.

|              Lead Acid                 | Ni-MH(Nickel–metal hydride) | Li-ion(Lithium Ion) & Li-Po(Lithium polymer)  |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|Big and heavy                           |Small and light              | Small and light & good for portable projects   |
|Cheap and good for low-budget projects  |Easy to use                  | Best energy density                            |
|Good for non-portable projects          |Suitable for beginners       | Can be expensive                               |
|Easy to use                             |Energy density isn't good enough| Suitable for advanced users                 |
|Safe                                    |Safe                         | Can pose risks and need protection circuit     |


## The average characteristics of each type:
|          |        Lead Acid      | Ni-MH(Nickel–metal hydride) | Li-ion(Lithium Ion) | Li-Po(Lithium polymer)  |
|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
|Volt      |12 V                   | 1.2 V                       | 3.6 V               |11.2 V                   |
|Capacity  |4.5 Ah                 | 2450 mAh                    | 2500 mAh            |4 Ah                     |
|Power hour|54 Wh                  |2.94 Wh                      | 9 Wh                |44 Wh                    |
|Weight    |1.6 Kg                 | 0.03 Kg                     | 0.043 Kg            |0.31 Kg                  |
|Price     |~14.84 $               |~4.24 $                      | ~6.522 $            |~33.6 $                  | 


## By looking at these characteristics of each battery, we can predict that either Li-ion or Li-Po would be the most suitable type to use for our project. Despite the fact that they are dangerous and more expensive than the other types, they could offer the best energy density. Moreover, they are small thus suitable for our projects that are portable.
